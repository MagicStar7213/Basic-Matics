This is a rewrite of my Basic-Matics app to Python

This is the start of a migration from my original app written in Kotlin to Python, as I found many bugs and
I want to rewrite it in a simpler way.

## Installation ##
Python 3 is necessary for building this app.
### UNIX / Linux ###
You just need to install build module

`pip3 install --upgrade build`

Then, `cd` to the project directory and run

`python3 -m build && pip3 install basicmatics-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl`

Now it's successfully installed! To run it, type

`python3 -m basicmatics`

### Windows ###
You just need to install build module

`pip install --upgrade build`

Then, `cd` to the project directory and run

`python -m build && pip install basicmatics-$VERSION-py3-none-any.whl`

Now it's successfully installed! To run it, type

`python -m basicmatics`

## Usage ##
This is a very simple app, and it is everything clear when you run it.

It is pretty clear and intuitive, so you won't have problem
